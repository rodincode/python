    "This code give you the window open for limited period of time.We have to add inifinite loop so the program never gets close without user wish.\n",

    "KEYDOWN : Gets triggered when the user any keyboard button.When we recieve a KEYDOWN event, the event object will hold the code of the key that was pressed in an attribute called ‘key’. So by comparing event.key to whichever key we are interested in, we can find out if that was the actual key that was pressed.\n",
